# Brain Tumor Detection System

## Project Overview
Brain tumors are one of the most common and aggressive diseases, often leading to a very short life expectancy in advanced stages. Early detection and timely treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes. This **Brain Tumor Detection System** automates the process of detecting tumors from scans and helps users analyze symptoms and connect with doctors for appropriate treatment.

## Key Features

### User Module
- User registration and login with personal credentials.
- Symptom analysis for automatic tumor detection.
- View a list of available doctors.
- Provide feedback on the system and doctors.
- Change password in case of an emergency.

### Admin Module
- Admin can add new doctors to the system.
- Admin can manage and add training data for the tumor detection system.
- Admin can view and manage user and doctor information.
- Admin can review and manage feedback submitted by users.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-end**: Python (for tumor detection using machine learning)
